It's 10:53 AM on a Saturday morning. My friend [Summer](https://twitter.com/suymilk) and I are attending our first intercollegiate hackathon - [Wildhacks](http://wildhacks.org). We've secured a spot in the corner of the Northwestern Room on the second floor of the student center overlooking the Lakefill. We've also laid claim to a power strip.

We're not in this hackathon for the prize money - we're doing it just to have the experience of building something in 24 hours or less, and also so we'll be a little less scared of doing hackathons in the future. I'll be liveblogging WildHacks just for [shiggles](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shiggles).

### 11 AM
As expected, this hackathon is overwhelmingly male. The group of guys next to us have already requested a whiteboard (they were told that there's a lot of paper that they can use).

"That's the most expensive mouse pad I've ever seen."
"We're counting the number of commits, not the quality of commits."
