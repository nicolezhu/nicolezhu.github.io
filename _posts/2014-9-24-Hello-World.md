title: A new blog
---

It's a new school year and I figured it's time to start a blog where I'll actually write things instead of just reblogging Parks and Rec screencaps. This site was made following [this tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) - "Build a Blog with Jekyll and Github Pages." Clark's tutorial is easy to follow and he also details the advantages of a Jekyll-powered blog:

* **No database:** all posts and pages are converted to static HTML prior to publication (good for loading speed)
* **No CMS:** posts can be written in Markdown (so they can also be written in a web browser or while on-the-go)
* **Fast:** makes fewer HTTP requests and since it's serving static pages, the site doesn't have to load a database
* **Minimal:** your Jekyll site doesn't contain features or functionality that you aren't using

I also thought it would be a good opporunity to get some more experience with Ruby and SASS, and getting used to writing in Markdown. The minimal aspect of Jekyll means that this blog will be a blank canvas. I'll probably redesign parts of it soon, and maybe add a "Currently Reading" section with the Goodreads API.

I'll also try to use this as an incentive to write more and write more clearly. The ultimate goal would be to [write every day](http://t.co/eBECUHnDfh) but this seems to be a good place to start.
