title: All the think pieces I've read about Beyonc&eacute;'s "Formation" (so far)
---

I've been listening to Beyonc&eacute;'s ["Formation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrCHz1gwzTo) on repeat since it dropped last Saturday (if you haven't listened to it/seen the video 390192 times by now who are you), so naturally I've also been devouring every think piece out there about the sheer amazingness of this song (and Beyonc&eacute; in general). Then my [friend](https://twitter.com/duner) texted me today asking "omg the new beyonce send me all the best essays plz" so here they are:

**BONUS:** Jenna Wortham [received](http://www.refinery29.com/2016/02/103033/beyonce-sends-flowers-to-reporter) a HANDWRITTEN LETTER FROM THE QUEEN HERSELF FOR THE ARTICLE SHE WROTE. Everyone else's job is garbage unless it means Beyonc&eacute; personally writes you thank you cards.
